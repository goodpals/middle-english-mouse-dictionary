Scripts for ingesting data into a form we can use.

Tolkien stuff is from [here](https://github.com/digitaltolkien/a-middle-english-vocabulary). `data/tolkien.txt` is just the glossary entries, and `data/tolkien_original.txt` is the original taken from the digitaltolkien repo. It contains some stuff we aren't using yet, and it is also a useful reference.

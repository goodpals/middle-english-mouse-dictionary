DICTIONARIES: 
- https://github.com/JonathanReeve/chaucer-macro-etym/blob/master/parse-CMED.ipynb
  ^^ built from https://github.com/GITenberg/A-Concise-Dictionary-of-Middle-EnglishFrom-A.D.-1150-to-1580_10625
- https://github.com/digitaltolkien/a-middle-english-vocabulary
  ^^this one is probably better; JRR Tolkien did it

we prolly shouldn't use this but it does exist: https://github.com/mdm-code/cmed

Manifest.json options we could integrate later:  
imo the icon should be a lil' medieval manuscript illumination style mouse icon seeing as this is a medieval mouse dictionary

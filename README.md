# Middle English Mouse Dictionary  

The Middle English Mouse Dictionary is a prototype browser extension for [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/) that assists in reading middle english web pages by showing dictionary information about middle english words when they are highlighted or double-clicked. It tracks which words you add to your personal word list for each tab, and displays them in a sidebar.

Install the extension [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/memd/).  


## Roadmap

At present this is a prototype, written in pure JS to be as simple as possible. 
In time we intend to: 
- Add additional dictionaries.
- Implement fuzzy matching to combat orthographic complexity
- Improve the UI and UX
- Adapt for Chrome/Safari and Manifest V3
- Move over to a framework if we deem it suitable
- Get funding and/or support from institutions
